### Hi There, glad to see you're here 👋
I'm **Azazel**, a software engineer from Vietnam 🇻🇳

I enjoy bringing ideas to life with code.

Currently, I'm learning and building stuff with **Java**, **TypeScript**, **React**,... 

- 🎨 I love creating a smooth user experience.
- 🛠️ I tinker with backend APIs and databases.
- 🌱 Always curious, always learning (Currently Learning: Kotlin, DevOps, and Minecraft Mods/Plugins).

When I'm not coding, I will:

- 🎵 Listening to music — recently, I've been into songs like Feel it by d4vd.
- 🎮 Playing games like Minecraft and some indie games.

Here are my socials if you want to contact me:
